Web Dev Fall 2018 HW06 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Zach Walsh


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/zwalsh/tasks1


3. What's the version number of your github release?
1.0


4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
tasks1.zachwal.sh


5. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
It is functionally (mostly) complete, although I would have liked to
add a separate "complete" feature for tasks, rather than one edit
page.


6. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
It is deployed. The database permits all connections from
localhost, though, which is probably a security risk.




And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
